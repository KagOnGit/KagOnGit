Data Analyst | FinTech Enthusiast | Full-Stack Developer
--------------------------------------------------------

I’m Aditya Singh, a final-year B.Tech Computer Science & Systems Engineering student at KIIT University (Graduating 2026), passionate about data, finance, and technology.

Over the past few years, I’ve built hands-on experience in \*\*data analytics, visualization, and full-stack development\*\*, completing projects and internships where I:

\- Optimized SQL pipelines and reduced reporting runtime by 15% during my internship at Sukrit Technologies.

\- Conducted exploratory data analysis and built Tableau dashboards as part of the NUS Global Immersion Program.

\- Designed and deployed personal projects like \*\*DealLens AI (AI-powered M&A screener)\*\* and a \*\*Financial Market Intelligence Dashboard\*\* inspired by Bloomberg Terminal UIs.

My technical toolkit includes \*\*Python, SQL, Power BI, Tableau, Next.js, and Streamlit\*\*, with strong foundations in databases, cloud, and modern web stacks. I enjoy combining technical and financial knowledge to deliver actionable insights and create tools that solve real-world problems.

Currently, I’m preparing for CFA Level 1 (Feb 2026) while working on AI-driven analytics and fintech products. My goal is to grow as a Data Analyst/FinTech Engineer, bridging the gap between business impact and technology.
